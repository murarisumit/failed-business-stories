Here i would put stories where I learn from othe stories, i understood lot of them, but forgot over the period of time since I never read it after that as I haven't noted it down, so i would be writing thing down here hence-forth

## [Why my old business failed, how to not be a stupid failure like Louis Rossmann](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3c2dOw6Frg)

(Got from youtube comment):
Just a rough outline. I missed a few smaller points, but I feel like this covers the general topics in the video.

1. Taking money from the wrong investor: 
         Make sure the investor doesn't expect immediate returns.
2. Mission statement: 
         Clearly states what your business is trying to do. This is both for the customer to understand you business's purpose, but more importantly a way to remind yourself of what your focus should be and to avoid deviation from that plan.
3. Target demographic: 
         Know what your customers want and acclimate your business to them (ex: low prices makes you more appealing for people who want to save money, but you'll have to skimp on quality vs higher prices for better services which appeals for people who want better value)
4. Avoid scaling early:
        Just because you have more money than you started with doesn't necessarily mean you can do more/better for 
your business.
5. Avoid online marketplaces:
         Places like Amazon and eBay favor the customers. Even if you do everything right, you can't protect yourself from them.
6. Profit margins:
        If one failed transaction requires 19 complete transactions to cover the costs then the business is not sustainable.
7. Specialize:
        You'll (likely) make better business doing something not many people can do for a higher price than doing something many people can do for a lower price.
